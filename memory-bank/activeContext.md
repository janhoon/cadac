# Active Context: CADAC

## Current Work Focus
The project has completed its foundational SQL execution engine with PostgreSQL support and comprehensive integration testing. Current focus areas:

1. **Data Model Management System**: Implementing table refresh and incremental update capabilities for data models
2. **Model Execution Modes**: Building full refresh (CREATE TABLE AS) and incremental update strategies
3. **Terminal UI Development**: Beginning implementation of the interactive terminal interface
4. **SQL Parsing Enhancements**: Improving table reference extraction and support for complex SQL constructs
5. **Multi-Database Support (Future)**: Databricks and Snowflake adapters will be implemented after core features are stable

   - Model dependency handling during refresh operations
   - Transaction management for model updates

3. **SQL Parsing Enhancements**

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- âœ… Platform-specific adapters using async trait-based architecture
- âœ… Connection management with connection string validation
- âœ… Execution result tracking with status, timing, and error reporting
- âœ… Optional feature flags for database-specific dependencies
- âœ… Model execution orchestration using dependency graph
- âœ… Upstream/downstream model selection for targeted execution
- âœ… Dry-run mode for execution planning and validation
- âœ… CLI run command with comprehensive execution options
- âœ… Comprehensive integration tests with test containers (11 test scenarios)
- âœ… Transaction management for rollback capabilities
- âœ… Comprehensive execution logging and monitoring
- âœ… Enhanced error handling and recovery with PostgreSQL error categorization

### Data Model Management Architecture (NEW FOCUS)
- ðŸ”² Model materialization strategies (full refresh vs incremental)
- ðŸ”² Table refresh via CREATE TABLE AS SELECT patterns
- ðŸ”² Incremental update detection and execution
- ðŸ”² Model configuration for execution modes
- ðŸ”² Abstraction layer over raw SQL commands for users
- ðŸ”² Model versioning and change detection
- ðŸ”² Dependency-aware model refresh orchestration

### Dependency System Architecture
- Using petgraph library for robust graph algorithms (cycle detection, topological sort)
- Schema-based folder organization: models/schema/table.sql â†’ schema.table
- Pure SQL approach with no templating or special syntax
- Environment portability through connection string database resolution

### Reference Resolution Strategy
- Qualified references (schema.table) â†’ direct model lookup
- Unqualified references (table) â†’ search current schema first
- Database-qualified references (db.schema.table) â†’ external tables, not model dependencies
- Context-aware resolution based on current model's schema location

### Model Identity System
- Folder structure determines schema: models/client/users.sql â†’ client.users
- Database comes from connection string/environment, not folder structure
- Support for nested organization folders that don't affect qualification
- Qualified names (schema.table) as primary model identifiers

### Testing Strategy
- Implementing comprehensive unit tests for parser functionality
- Creating integration tests for model discovery
- Using tempfile for test file creation
- Following TDD principles for new feature development

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Modules organized by functionality (parser, discovery, cli)
- Clear separation between parsing, discovery, and UI components
- Using traits for interface definitions (e.g., ModelParser)
- Implementing builder pattern for ModelMetadata construction

### Error Handling
- Using color-eyre for rich error reporting
- Implementing std::error::Error for custom error types
- Providing detailed error messages with context
- Using the ? operator for error propagation

### Testing Approach
- Writing tests before implementation (TDD)
- Creating specific test cases for different SQL constructs
- Testing error conditions and edge cases
- Using temporary directories for file-based tests

## Learnings and Project Insights

### SQL Parsing Challenges
- Tree-sitter grammar has specific node types that need careful handling
- SQL dialects have variations in syntax and semantics
- Comments contain valuable metadata that needs extraction
- AST traversal requires understanding of the grammar structure

### Model Discovery Insights
- File system traversal needs robust error handling
- Model naming conventions affect discovery logic
- Building a catalog requires efficient data structures
- Dependency tracking needs careful consideration of SQL semantics

### Project Evolution
- Moving from basic parsing to more sophisticated metadata extraction
- Shifting focus to model relationships and dependencies
- Building toward a comprehensive data catalog
- Preparing for terminal UI development
